React:
    - JavaScript Library
    - Created at Facebook
    - React docx
    - React blog


Babeljs.io:
    - react compiler to see why code isn't working in VSCode

Components:
    - use functions to display HTML or CSS content via JavaScript
    - Components are always capitalized

ReactDOM.render:
    - only returns one single element
    - If you want to return multiple components it is best to return a div
        of the wrapped content

Props:
    - make more dynamic code
    - each function has the opportunity to change the value while still using the same functions
    - less coding in general
    - pass prop value into component
    - then pass prop variable into function
    - return the prop dynamically

Keys
    - are important to lists in react

React.Fragment
    - a good wrapper tag instead of div because it does not add anything extra to the DOM.

useState:
    - a hook that can change the state of a value,
    - it has an initial value and then the setProperty allows you to change the value

useEffect:
    - changes state value at the beginning of page render
